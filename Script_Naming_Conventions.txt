Manually add shortcut to scripts

To define a keyboard shortcut, open Finder select the script file, and
highlight the name. Append to the name of the script a backslash "\", then one
or more modifiers. Then any A-Z upper-case letter (just one), representing the
lower-case letter you'll type. If naming from the commandline the \ will need
to be escaped (meaning 2 '\').

Example: If I have a script called "Backup Script", and I change its filename
to "Backup Script\coM", its keyboard shortcut will be Control-Option-M.

The Modifiers:
m - Command
c - Control
o - Option
s - Shift


Note: Option and Shift cannot be used on their own, since they're standard
typing keys, only in combination with Command and/or Control.

If you use .scpt extension: Add the "\" and modifiers and A-Z character before
the ".scpt". The extension should always be at the end of any file name, so the
system can identify the file type. (And if you choose not to "show all
extensions" in the Finder, that's exactly what will happen anyway.)
